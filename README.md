## 🎯 Executive Summary  
This project transforms complex COVID-19 datasets into a **data storytelling experience** using Tableau.  
By applying structured analytics under the **PPDAC research framework**, the study visualizes the spread, recovery, and vaccination progress of COVID-19 across India uncovering insights that inform **public health policy**, **resource planning**, and **data-driven decision-making**.  

The dashboard serves as both a **technical demonstration** of Tableau analytics capability and a **portfolio-ready artifact** that demonstrates end-to-end data analysis, transformation, and visualization proficiency.

## 🧠 Analytical Framework: PPDAC Approach  

### 1️⃣ Problem: Framing the Question  
The COVID-19 pandemic posed critical challenges for data-driven monitoring and decision-making. India, with its vast population and regional diversity, required clear visibility into infection dynamics and vaccination outcomes.  

**Analytical Goals:**  
- Quantify state-wise spread and containment efficiency.  
- Evaluate gender and age group exposure differences.  
- Assess national vaccination progress by vaccine type.  
- Identify testing capacity gaps across states.  
- Build an interactive, insight-driven dashboard for stakeholders.  

---

### 2️⃣ Plan: Designing the Analytical Roadmap  
A research-oriented plan was developed using **Tableau for visualization** and **Excel/Tableau Prep for preprocessing**.  
The objective was to build a **dashboard-driven analytical narrative**, guiding the audience through the pandemic’s evolution and the data insights behind it.  

**Key Design Principles:**  
- **Clarity:** Present critical health KPIs in an accessible format.  
- **Consistency:** Maintain unified color palettes and typography across all visuals.  
- **Comparability:** Enable interactive exploration (state filters, dose comparisons).  
- **Credibility:** Ensure all data sources are from verified open data platforms.

### 3️⃣ Data: Foundation for Insights  
**Source:**  
Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW), and verified open repositories.

**Data Components:**  
| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Confirmed Cases | Cumulative and daily state-wise data |
| Recovered & Deceased | Recovery/mortality trends |
| Vaccinations | Dose counts by vaccine and demographic |
| Testing | ICMR lab distribution by state |
| Demographics | Age and gender distribution of cases |

**Data Preparation:**  
- Missing and inconsistent entries handled using Tableau Prep.  
- Columns normalized for state-level mapping.  
- Derived fields added for calculated KPIs (e.g., Case Recovery Rate, Vaccination Ratio).  

---

### 4️⃣ Analysis: Extracting Meaning Through Visualization  
The Tableau dashboard integrates **quantitative storytelling** and **data visualization** to uncover relationships across dimensions.  

#### 📈 Dashboard Components  
- **Covid Cases by State:** Dual-axis trendline comparing confirmed, recovered, and death counts.  
- **Vaccination Overview:** Comparison of first vs. second dose administration by vaccine type.  
- **Testing Insights:** ICMR lab count per state and total testing capacity.  
- **Demographics:** Gender and age-based exposure visualization.  
- **State Filters:** Interactive drill-down for granular insights.  

#### 🧩 Analytical Highlights  
- Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu led national testing efforts, indicating high public health response capacity.  
- CoviShield accounted for **~80% of all doses**, showing dependency on one vaccine type.  
- Age groups **20–39** had the highest case exposure, suggesting higher workforce mobility risk.  
- Female participation in vaccination was marginally lower, indicating potential outreach gaps.  

#### 🎨 Design Focus  
- Dark dashboard theme to improve focus and contrast.  
- Unified grid layout for professional dashboard storytelling.  
- KPI cards and charts styled for **executive-level readability**.

### 5️⃣ Conclusion: Insights and Data-Driven Impact  
This analysis demonstrates how **data storytelling converts public health records into actionable knowledge**.  
The dashboard supports:  
- **Policy insight generation**: highlighting vaccination coverage and testing disparities.  
- **Data-driven monitoring**: enabling state and national performance benchmarking.  
- **Public communication**:presenting complex datasets in an intuitive format.  

**Quantitative Impact:**  
- 5+ key performance indicators visualized across 28 states.  
- >80 million vaccination records aggregated for comparative analysis.  
- 6 major dashboard panels supporting interlinked exploratory views.  

This work exemplifies how **data analytics, visualization, and domain context** merge to drive informed decision-making and effective communication.
